# wlan10

Wi-fi network manager for Windows 10. Bringing back the functionality Microsoft removed, and more.

If I helped you, please say thanks! (how you can do this is below)

## Requirements

* Windows 10 or 8.1 (may also work on 8, 7)
* .NET 4 or higher
* Wireless networks

## Usage

Open the app. Some wifi networks should show up in the list.

> **If no wifi networks show up, you need to connect to some wireless networks first!**  
> Setting up a wireless network through the >app is not supported.

Drag and drop the networks to change the order to your liking. Hit the save button to store this new order. Windows should now prefer the networks which you put on top, selecting the highest positioned available network. Setting autoconnect and autoswitching (read more about autoswitching below) doesn't require saving.  

The tool is only required for setup, and can be removed once everything is configured. See [the blog for more](http://blog.bertware.net/2016/07/set-windows-network-priority-wlan10/).

> **Note:** What is autoswitching?
>
> The `autoSwitch` (`WLANProfile`) element determines the roaming behavior of an auto-connected network when a more preferred network is in range. This element is optional.
>
> If `autoSwitch` is `true` and `connectionMode` is set to `auto`, a connection to a more preferred network must be attempted whenever a more preferred network comes into range. A more preferred network is one that is ordered higher in the list of preferred wireless networks. This connection attempt occurs when connected to another network.
>
> An `autoSwitch` value set to `true` results in a higher frequency of periodic scanning for new networks. This may result in increased radio frequency pollution from these periodic scans and increased power consumption used by the wireless network adapter.
